            Policy Against Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE)
            <br>
            We maintain a zero-tolerance policy toward any form of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) or exploitation on our platform.
            <br>
            Our app does not allow the sharing or hosting of user-generated content that depicts, promotes, or glorifies CSAE in any way.
            <br>
            We:
            <br>
            Use content moderation and reporting tools to monitor and review content.
            <br>
            Immediately remove any content that violates this policy.
            <br>
            Report CSAE content to appropriate legal authorities and organizations, including NCMEC.
            <br>
            Provide tools for users to report abuse directly in-app or by emailing [your support email].
            <br>
            If you become aware of content that may violate this policy, please contact us at
